EPD is a new encapsulated vectorial graphic format.
The project is GPL and you can find it at
http://EPD.sourceforge.net/

The idea is very simple and powerful:
EPD uses the standard PDF (Adobe trademark) graphic syntax.
Every line is only one command.
Every line starting with # is a comment.
The command BBox(x1,y1,x2,y2) will specify the Bounding Box.
This is a simple example

# This is only a test with the new EPD format
BBox(-50.87109,97.4201,668.62891,700.57977)

It's very simple with EPD create an archive of graphical objects.
We're developing a simple application to use an EPD: epd2svg
The official W3C overview of the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format is at
http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/
If you need a SVG browser viewer we suggest you the Adobe SVG plug-in
http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/

We hope many applications will support EPD, to create EPD objects and
to include EPD objects in other formats.
