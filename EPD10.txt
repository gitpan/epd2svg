EPD: a new encapsulated vectorial graphic format

File Structure
Every line started with % is a Comment Line.
The first line of a EDF file specifies the version number of the EDF.
%EDP-1.0

Every line is one unique command.

The command 
%BBox(x1,y1,x2,y2)
specifies the Bounding Box of the embedded object
the width is x2-x1
the height is y2-y1

Like PDF (Adobe TradeMark), "by default, user space coordinates have 72 units
per inch, corresponding roughly to the various definitions of the typographic
unit of measurement known as the point. The positive direction of the y-axis
points upward, and the positive direction of the x-axis to the right" 
(paragraph 3.2 page 30):
the origin (0,0) is the low left corner.

Now you can use to construct an EPD every command describes in the Portable Document Format
Reference Manual Version 1.3 in the paragraphs 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6.

e.g. this is the first part of the john.epd example:
%EPD-1.0
% This is only a test with the new EPD format
%BBox(1,1,70,80)

It's very simple with EPD create an archive of graphical objects.
We're developing a simple application to use an EPD:
epd2svg
The official W3C overview of the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format is at
http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/
If you need a SVG browser viewer
http://www.adobe.com/svg/main.html

We hope many applications will support EPD, to create EPD objects and
to include EPD objects in other formats.
